## Activity overview

Reports are essential for helping remediate findings, especially for cybersecurity, compliance, and quality assurance. These reports often highlight vulnerabilities, issues, or non-compliance with established standards. By analyzing these reports, you can identify areas for improvement and gather data-driven evidence to make informed decisions. Concrete data enables efficient prioritization and resource allocation to address the identified issues.

Consequently, addressing the findings outlined in reports helps mitigate potential risks and vulnerabilities that could otherwise be exploited. This is especially critical in cybersecurity, where unaddressed issues can lead to data breaches or system compromises.

As a cloud security analyst, you are responsible for evaluating controls against established standards to ensure that an organization's security posture is effective, compliant, and aligned with industry best practices. This evaluation process is crucial for helping with risk management, compliance, and continuous security improvement, ultimately helping organizations protect sensitive data, systems, and their overall reputation.

In this lab, you’ll use the Security Command Center interface to identify and remediate threats and vulnerabilities, and confirm that the issues have been resolved.

## Scenario

In your role as a newly appointed junior cloud security analyst at Cymbal Bank, one of your critical responsibilities includes identifying and mitigating threats and vulnerabilities in a timely and effective manner. Your team lead, Chloe, has approached you with a report that highlights security concerns on the company network. Specifically, they have recently discovered that there is a Cloud Storage bucket within the organization that contains sensitive documents and is incorrectly configured. You’ll need to correctly configure the bucket and verify that the issues have been resolved.

Here’s how you'll do this task: **First**, you’ll use the Security Command Center to identify and verify the security threats. **Then**, you’ll remediate the high and medium risk issues. **Finally**, you’ll run a compliance report to verify that the remediation has been successful.
